        Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. Only God can make a tree
        - but you can paint one. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. It just happens - whether or not you worried about
        it or tried to plan it. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.

        This is your world. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? You create the dream - then
        you bring it into your world. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. We can fix anything.

        I get carried away with this brush cleaning. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
        There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Maybe he has a little friend that 
        lives right over here. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. A beautiful little sunset.
